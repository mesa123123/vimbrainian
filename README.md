# VIMBRAINAIN

I need a tool that automates a lot of the manual work I do with my note taking so I can do stuff quicker in vim.
I like:
    * backlinking
    * brain diagrams
    * markdown automation
    * perhaps "turn highlighted text into a link"
    * Maybe group all the snippets along with it too?
    * Tag Searching!
    * Reference Searching?
    * Collating all relevant stuff into one document? (like from contents notes (which are little more than big groups of links to other notes) and then create a big note from the associated notes)
        * Perhaps you could have a depth search going on there? Like, link-depth 2 or something? (or would that require me to have more than one type of link, i.e. `linktype1: this link goes into more detail about subject` `linktype2: this link goes off on a related subject`)
