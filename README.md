# VIMBRAINAIN

I need a tool that automates a lot of the manual work I do with my note taking so I can do stuff quicker in vim.
I like:
* backlinking
* brain diagrams
* markdown automation
* perhaps "turn highlighted text into a link"
* Maybe group all the snippets along with it too?
* Tag Searching!
* Reference Searching?
* Collating all relevant stuff into one document? (like from contents notes (which are little more than big groups of links to other notes) and then create a big note from the associated notes)
   * Perhaps you could have a depth search going on there? Like, link-depth 2 or something? (or would that require me to have more than one type of link, i.e. `linktype1: this link goes into more detail about subject` `linktype2: this link goes off on a related subject`)
   * A way to create notes on different folder levels? (Perhaps have a tagging hierachy? i.e. `tagtype1 can define which folder/subfolders it can go in, 1stIn1stServed style, tagtype2 can just be regular tags?`, though this might be overkill)
